<h4>Hi, I'm Daniel</h4>

<p>I've worked in a variety of sectors - from nonprofits, to higher education, the public sector, and [software development]</p>

<p>I joined Coding Dojo to learn full stack software development in order to understand [the full application development and optimization process].  At Coding Dojo, I had opportunities not only to learn with peers through pair programming, but to collaborate on several projects built with the technologies learned in each stack.</p>

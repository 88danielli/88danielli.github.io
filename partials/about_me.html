<h4>Hi, I'm Daniel</h4>

<p>I grew up in the Bay Area and now live in Sunnyvale, CA.</p>

<p>I've worked in a variety of sectors - from nonprofits, to higher education, the public sector, and technology</p>

<p>I joined Coding Dojo to learn full stack software development in order to understand [the full application development and optimization process].  At Coding Dojo, I had opportunities not only to learn with peers through pair programming, but to collaborate on several projects built with the technologies learned in each stack.</p>

<p>I thrive in these small groups with a common goal.  I enjoy seeing how the group can come together to allow each person to contribute their strengths in a combined effort to make an idea come to life.  I gravitate towards the back-end server logic and database request and response process, but greatly value being able to understand how a decision in each piece of the stack can affect the efficiency of other pieces.</p>

<p>Coding is challenging.  There are so many tools available there is seemingly always something else to learn.  A new skill to add.  The [breadth] may seem daunting.  But coding is also creative.  Coding is collaborative, whether on a small project team or contributing to open source projects, we have resources available.  And if it doesn't exist yet, we can make it.  Coding is exciting.  That's why to me, coding is more than a profession.  Coding is passion!</p>
